# Open MIDI Visualizer

Open MIDI Visualizer, or OMIDIV for short, or OMV for shorter, or Open Musical Information Data Interchange Visualizer for long, is an open source MIDI visualizer and audio player.

Not a midi *player*. Just a visualizer.  
If you want audio, render it separately and open it.  
If the audio doesn't sync up with the notes, use the Offset (ms) in the audio or midi control window.  
If you change something and it doesn't do anything, try pressing F6 (to reload the midi, can be done while playing), or F5 (to reload and reset everything).

## Todo list

- Why does reloading change depth spacing again?
- Separate note height and depth
